# Checkuwp
Used in Rancho Lab School as an efficient way of checking students in and out of the classroom.

Source code for: http://rnchchk.weebly.com/

Created in Visual Studio 2019 with UWP (Universal Windows Platform)

Specifically made for Raspberry Pi with Adafruit PWM controller connected to two PWM controlled servos.

Was originally designed for two containers containing keys that would could be dropped via activation from the program.

NOTE: This code was semi-hardcoded and used many bad practices in programming. If I could redo this project, I would completely restructure everything :p

Current commit is stable and tested.
